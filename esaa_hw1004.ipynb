            Acquiring satellites is very fast though if you are moving while the acquisition is taking place it will take a little longer to acquire a satellite and of course on a overcast day you may experience difficulty acquiring a signal though understandable .\\n8                                                                                                                                                                                 I would say that 90% of the time it acquires a satellite within the first 2 minutes or less, the other 10% is due to the above events .\\n9                                                                                                                                                                 And it is very fast locating satellites, the new

to interferrence by the tall buildings arroung .\\n13                   Can pay like $200 or something and get the service for life, HotFix which allows it to get satellites much faster when booting up this is a great feature and my only complaint about past Garmins that I used which was that it took too long to acquire satellites, this eliminates that problem .\\n14

                                                                                                                                                                    It lost satellite contact a couple of times on the trip   but apparently picked them up again because there were no skipped directions .\\n29

connection came back .\\n30                                                                                                                                                                                                                                        When you turn on the unit, initial satellite connection takes about 3 minutes .\\n31                                                                                                                                                                                                I really love the new interface, the turn signs at the corner, speed limit indicator and the fast satellite reception .\\n32                                                                                                                                                                                                                                          The refreshing rate is fast and locks on to the satellites almost instantly .\\n33                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                    It doesn't take long to locate satellites, maybe 15 seconds or so .\\n34                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                          Good routing  , easy to use, quick to lock on to satellites .\\n35                                                                                                                                                                    But unlike my previous Garmin, the satellite acquisition is very fast, and recalculation when I deviate from the stated route is almost immediate .\\n36

reliable satellite connection .\\n37                                                                                                                                                                                                                     I was able to connect to a satellite within about five minutes of taking the unit out of the box .\\n38                                                                                                                                                                                                                                             I have noticed no problems with this unit's ability to detect satellites .\\n39                                                                                                                         It takes a little while to get the satellites sometimes, but I just set it up as soon as I get in the car and by the time I'm out on the road and actually need directions it's up and going .\\n40                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                  When powered up initially it does a one, time search for satellites .\\n41                                                                                                                                                                                                                                         I took the unit outside to do that, and it found the satellites very quickly .\\n42

                                                                                                                                                                                  It is much faster to find the satellite signals than my friend's TomTom 910 .\\n44

features I don't know about, but just have to link it up to the satellites and off you go .\\n46                                                                                                                                                                                                                                 Many places in Northern Montana and especially Utah lost contact with satellite info .\\n47                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                    The satellite fix is very fast, about twice as fast as my old one .\\n48

made the best choice for my money .\\n49

                                            Even when my pickup is in the garage overnight with no power to the unit when I back out the next day it has the satellites instantly .\\n52

                          The 255W finds satellites faster than any other GPS on the market .\\n53                                                                                                                                             It includes the new Hot Fit technology and remembers the satellites positions when you turn the GPS off, so the next time you turn it on, it can relocate them very fast .\\n54

about 5 seconds while inside my garage .\\n56

                                                                                                                                                                      Took a few minutes for the unit to link up with the satellite, but once that was done, it was a breeze .\\n58                                                                                                                                                                           Also, as a novice user, I am really surprised at the time it takes for it to capture satellite signals, holding it up to the sky, outdoors .\\n59

            Acquiring satellites is very fast though if you are moving while the acquisition is taking place it will take a little longer to acquire a satellite and of course on a overcast day you may

                                            I would say that 90% of the time it acquires a satellite within the first 2 minutes or less, the other 10% is due to the above events .\\n9                                                                                                                                                                 And it is very fast locating satellites, the new

to interferrence by the tall buildings arroung .\\n13                   Can pay like $200 or something and get the service for life, HotFix which allows it to get satellites much faster when booting up this is a great feature and my only complaint about past Garmins that I used which was that it took too long to acquire satellites, this eliminates that problem .\\n14

                                                I was able to connect to a satellite within about five minutes of taking the unit out of the box .\\n38

takes a little while to get the satellites sometimes, but I just set it up as soon as I get in the car and by the time I'm out on the road and actually need directions it's up and going .\\n40

fact from fiction or even to tell whether or not someone was having a bad day when they arrived or left or whether or not a guest was rude him herself and thus caused the hotel staff to be standoffish

                     If you walk in feeling entitled with your nose up in the air like they owe you something, then I daresay you might find something to squawk about, but the hotel staff I encountered doesn\\u0092t sound anything like the staff some reviewers have mentioned .\\n35

small keyboard I've ever used, because the keys are flat and so the surfaces that your fingerpads touch are actually about the size of standard keyboards .\\n13   It won't give you all the functionality of a full, sized laptop, and the small screen may take some getting used to, but no regular laptop gives you this kind of battery life, and most of the functions absent here aren't used by most people most of the time anyway, so if the tradeoff is fewer features for greatly, increased battery life, I'll take the latter .\\n14

battery life that greatly exceeds most full size laptops .\\n43

                                        My system seems to be faster, all of my previous programs and peripherals run without a problem, things come up quicker when clicking on them and I love the new

However, when we arrived at our room there was a maintenance worker there measuring the bathroom counter, so maybe they're doing work in some units .\\n38

arrival, there was a SLIGHT odor in bathroom but nothing worth complaining about .\\n43

adequate with thick, fluffy towels .\\n44

                                                                                                                                                                                                 The bathroom was very clean and well appointed with nice towels and toiletries, it was not big, but room enough to do what one needs to .\\n46                                                                                                                                                                                                                       The Tuscan Inn room was quite nicely appointed, the bed was comfortable the chairs   TV adequate, the bathroom reasonably good .\\n47                                                                                                                                       my only real complaint would be that the bathroom does not have a separate vanity area, so 2 people getting dressed had to improvise, which was kind of surprising since the bathrooms were all redone on 2005 .\\n48                                                                                                                     The clever use of mirrors behind the bed helped to create the illusion of space, however, in reality the room was cramped and with two of us trying to use the hand basin and bathroom at the same time was particularly awkward .\\n49                                                                                                                                                                                                                    The bathroom containing the toilet and the shower was also very small, not to mention the sink and counter directly outside of it .\\n50   Turning the bathroom light on also turns the counter light on, meaning a middle, of, the, night trip to the bathroom means the whole side of the room gets illuminated  and the wooden shutters that were installed in place of traditional curtains to add to the hotel's theme do absolutely nothing to keep the room dark once the sun comes up .\\n51

the bathroomm was very small .\\n52

         The wash basin was in the room without any privacy and there was a small bathroom for the toilet and bath shower .\\n54

remodeled in alignment, but it was all very clean and perfectly acceptable .\\n55

had several problems .\\n56

                                  The shower stall could have been bigger as the bathroom itself was pretty large .\\n58

around the room with plates was difficult in the crowded circumstances .\\n1

                           I can't see what sets it apart from other 3, star hotels I've stayed in ,  other than the fact it's in London, in a posh area and has good food .\\n8

ate breakfast at the hotel a couple of days and thought it was overprice for the quality of food .\\n9

reasonable selection of food, general ambience in restaurant more like a youth hostel .\\n12

.\\n16                                                                                                                                                                                                                           It is very convenient to the Gloucester Road tube stop, grocery store, drug store and fast food places .\\n17

                               The location is just around the corner from the tube, Boots and Waitrose   right next door, close to many restaurants including fast food if you like .\\n19

in the room, but it was completely reserved for the mini, bar service beverages, which completely filled it .\\n20

beginning to run low we went down at 9 .\\n21                                                                                                                                                                                               There were Italian, Indian, British, American fast food, and Thai restaurants very close to the hotel on Cromwell   Gloucester Rds .\\n22

but was chosen from the current uninspired Holiday Inn room service menu, when I ordered a \\u00a36 .\\n23

minutes away to save money .\\n24

foods .\\n27                                                                                                                                                                                                        We ate on evening once at the Garfunkels pub in the mall, it was typical chain restaurant food but fast with good service .\\n28

                                      Not exactly what most tourists are looking for but when you have been out of the states as long as we have you eat fast food when you get the chance !\\n30

 There is no mini, fridge in standard rooms, so you can't store any food ,  the hotel used to have mini, fridges .\\n31

restaurant this morning prior to check out ,  this restaurant is on the first floor and is one of the buffet style breakfasts so lukewarm food and very busy .\\n36

The hotel itself was very pleasant ,  the staff friendly and helpful and I can only comment on the breakfasts as this was the only meal that we had there ,  the food was excellent with a wide variety of choice .\\n38

                   If you like Indian food we ate at the Dehli Brassiere it was exellent and more reasonably priced .\\n42

price you are paying it is not simply worth it .\\n43

couple of steak places, a number of Indian restaurants and some fast food, so it's convenient for that .\\n45                                                                 Within 200 yards of leaving the hotel and heading to the Tube Station   you have a number of fast food outlets, highstreet Restautants, Pastry shops and supermarkets, so if you did wish to live in your hotel room for the duration of your stay, you could do !\\n46                                                                                                                                                                                                                as for the continental breakfast taste was good but became boring after the 3rd day the food served wasnt changed .\\n47                                                                                                                                                                                        We ate in the bistro downstairs and the food was very good ,  although the portions varied significantly depending on the chef that night .\\n48    The buffet breakfast is ok although not the best I've had and usually includes a selection of fresh fruit as well as the usual 'full english' The food in the ground floor restaurant is good  I haven't had problems with room service although the menu has recently changed and doesn't have as good a selection as it did .\\n49

      I can also tell you that there is nothing fantastic about the food .\\n51

clean and we actually got a pretty good view this time .\\n60

such as cost, location etc .\\n64

your trip, has you turn the wrong way down a one way road, tell you to turn AFTER you've passed the street, frequently loses the satellite signal, or has old maps missing streets, you know how important this stuff is .\\n1                                                                                                                                                                       The Garmin Nuvi 255W connects to satellites extremely fast, , So when I get in my car and turn it on, we're pretty much ready to go immediately .\\n2                                                                                                                                                                                                                      It picks up the satellites quickly  , routes fast, has good animation maybe 6, 8 frames a second ?\\n3

                                                                                                                          The unit takes very quickly locks on to satellite signals, tracks very well and when you miss a turn or do something unexpected, recalculates a new route very quickly .\\n5

well .\\n6                                                                                                                                                         On I, 76 in PA, I travelled through a mile long tunnel and it tracked me perfectly even though it obviously could not get satellite signals inside the tunnel .\\n7                                                           Acquiring satellites is very fast though if you are moving while the acquisition is taking place it will take a little longer to acquire a satellite and of course on a overcast day you may experience difficulty acquiring a signal though understandable .\\n8                                                                                                                                                                                 I would say that 90% of the time it acquires a satellite within the first 2 minutes or less, the other 10% is due to the above events .\\n9                                                                                                                                                                 And it is very fast locating satellites, the new interface needs some time to get used to, it is very cool now you can drag the map with your fingers !\\n10                                                                                                                                                                                                                            It is quick in picking up satellite signals and very responsive with the user interface   .\\n11                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                 Satellite lock, up and navigation precision was better for TomTom, e .\\n12                                                                                                                                                         I guess it was because during the traffic jams we encountered I guess it loss contact with the satellites due to interferrence by the tall buildings arroung .\\n13                   Can pay like $200 or something and get the service for life, HotFix which allows it to get satellites much faster when booting up this is a great feature and my only complaint about past Garmins that I used which was that it took too long to acquire satellites, this eliminates that problem .\\n14                                                                                      by the time the main menu comes up after turning the device on it generally already has a full 100% signal from the satellites and it's ready to navigate, a beautiful crystal clear LCD widescreen, and tons of other features .\\n15

                                                                                                                      It also has a  hot fix  which finds satellites faster ,  which is very useful for starting your trip immediately and great for recalculating routes very quickly .\\n17                                                                                                                                                               SATELLITE RECEPTION, , Being in downtown Charlotte with skyscrapers surrounding me, the Nuvi maintained reception everywhere except a parking garage   .\\n18                                                                                                                                                                                          On a major highway leading into downtown it lost all satellite coverage and told me to make a U, turn on the 6 lane highway !\\n19

the older versions without it .\\n20

long to locate satellites, maybe 15 seconds or so .\\n34

                                                                                                                                                                         The gadget feeling is underlined by needing to press a button to turn pages .\\n4                                                                                                                                                  It took very little time to get used to having to push a button to turn pages and the screen flash as they turn only really startled me the first few times .\\n5                                                                                                                                 I don't feel the need to push the button ahead of time to prepare for the end of the page at all, which evidently a lot of Kindle 1 owners do since it's a bit more sluggish .\\n6                                                unintended page changes, the awkward way I sometimes have to hold it to keep from hitting buttons, the sometimes slow page refresh, and the screen freezes that now has me traveling with a paper clip lest I need to do a reset while commuting on the train .\\n7                                                                                                                                                                                                                                 No longer do I have to press and hold two buttons to put the device to sleep .\\n8

                                                                                                                                                                                                                                   You need to press on the interior of the button to get it to click .\\n10                                                                                                                                                                                                Combine that with the smaller button sizes and one major source of frustration has been instantly eliminated !\\n11                                                                                                                                                                                                                                    The little power button at the top of the Kindle is really a power slide .\\n12

back to the K1 .\\n13                                                                                                                                                 sleeker look and feel  , sharper screen, no longer accidentally depressing the next page button by accident and having to find your place in the book again .\\n14

down like the original version .\\n15                                                                                                       Only issue is I need to recalibrate now, , in general, I try to anticipate how much time it will take the next page to load, and when I'm two lines from the bottom, I would hit the next page button .\\n16

      Now I need to push the button later .\\n17

                                                                                                                                                                            The main issue I had with Kindle 1 was the navigation button design and placement .\\n19                                                                                                                                                                     I like to read holding the Kindle with one hand and it just didn't work well because I kept bumping the next, previous and back buttons .\\n20                                                                                                                                                                                                                                          The display is better and the 5, way button is a major improvement .\\n21                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                     On off buttons are repositioned to be easily accessible .\\n22    Things like the buttons that made it easy to accidentally turn pages  the separate cursor on the side that could only select lines and was sometimes hard to see  the occasionally awkward menus  the case which practically forced you to remove it to use it and sometimes pulled the battery door off .\\n23

                                                                                                                                                                                          This means that when you handle the Kindle 2 by the edges, the pages don't change even if you grab by the buttons .\\n25                                                                                                                                              Yet changing pages is effortless when you do ,  the buttons are right between your thumbs and the slightest pressure on their faces is enough to activate them .\\n26                                                                                                          That it doesn't have the quirky, clunky, annoying buttons that filled \\u00be of each side of its predecessor, buttons that caused dozens upon dozens of accidental page turns makes it that much sexier .\\n27                                                                                                                                                                                                                     What I like most about the Kindle 2 is the placement of the buttons and their inversion .\\n28                                                                                                                                                                                                              It has the feel of the mouse button in the middle of a laptop keyboard and I never liked those .\\n29                                                                                                                                                                                                   Manipulating that button reminded me of something I'd rather not think about when trying to get work done .\\n30                                                                                                                                      if you don't upgrade, you will regret it every time you accidentally hit one of the obscenely large buttons and advance or retreat one, two, three, or even four pages .\\n31                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                            The page turn buttons are better .\\n32

                                                                                                                                                                        With the Kindle 2, the buttons have been scaled down to a much more manageable size and are a lot less sensitive .\\n34

                                                           It took a little getting used to after having used the Kindle 1, especially since the context menus that I was used to in the first gen have changed due to the new directional button, but for any Kindle user, this change is a god send .\\n36

.\\n37                                                                                                                                                                                                                                           A button click brings up the dictionary, starting with that entry .\\n38

dedicated buttons .\\n39                                                                                                      The button layout looks odd because it's so regularly spaced in rows versus the keyboard's staggered style, but it isn't any harder to use than a cellphone's tri, letter entry or blackberry keyboard .\\n40

button a bit sooner than I finish reading the page .\\n43                                                                                        The lag actually helps in that respect, and even so, the lag between pushing the button and the new page appearing is much faster than I could ever physically flip any book page without shearing it from the spine .\\n44                                                                                                                                                                                                                ,  Inside, edge buttons ,  These have saved me from accidentally pressing buttons many times .\\n45

from the device,they've resent it to me and I've had to do the hold the power button for 20 seconds process each time .\\n53

                             Sleek style, easy to hold, the white causes it to disappear as suggested in its description, highly transportable, well thought out button placement, easy to use, adjustable font, ease of downloading new books .\\n56                                                                                                                                                                                              I love how the content manager is better integrated and I don't have to hit so many buttons to manage my books .\\n57

                     Since the K2 is longer and the buttons are near the bottom, its awkward to hold and feels unbalanced in my hands, almost like it will tip over .\\n59                                                                                                                                                                                                                             When I'm trying to go to the next page, I hit the home button by accident a lot .\\n60

turn on the TTS feature with one button, place it beside me, and have it read to me all night !\\n64

                 I worried that the new buttons would be Sony Reader size, and impossible for me to press .\\n66

                                         Also the keyboard has been redesigned to make things easier as well as added buttons like  menu  which is nice .\\n72

pressure, but I like it that way so I can rest my thumbs on the buttons without turning the page accidentally .\\n94                                                                                                          They seem to be in the perfect location, I can grip the K2 easily and do not have to worry about pressing a button on accident but when I need to change the page they are right where I want them .\\n95                                                                                                                                    Moving the cursor to the word in question can be a bit awkward since there is some delay using the 5 direction button, but it's not so awkward as to not use the feature .\\n96

you look at it, if you don't focus too hard, the little buttons and controls fade away and all you see is the text .\\n109                                                                                                       The only thing you can do is rotate, which makes some PDFs readable but then you're in the awkward position of having to press the next and previous page buttons vertically instead of horizontally .\\n110                                                                                                                                                                                                       One day while laying on the couch reading I pressed the 'next page' button and the screen went blank .\\n111

page  button has become second nature .\\n112                                                                                                                           My one complaint is that I'd like a  previous page  button on both side of the screen, the way there's a  next page  button on both sides, but that's a very minor consideration .\\n113

it isn't making the left, edge buttons hard to press .\\n114                                                                                                                                                               To use the  enter  function, that is to execute a command or enter the text I've typed in, I just have to push downward on the square button .\\n115

                  The prev next back home buttons are too small ?\\n116

               The new navigation button works well, and the keyboard   feels good to my fingers .\\n122

buttons on the side of the device used for page turning, going to the home screen, and accessing the menu all engage with an inward click .\\n128

with the edges without pressing any buttons .\\n129

                                                        The page turning buttons are a lot easier to hit than say, flipping a page in a real book while lying in bed, having said page get caught up on the covers, and having to adjust to get it squared away .\\n131

                                      I don't need two hands to hold the book open when I'm on the train, or whenever, just one hand gives you good access to all the buttons even while you are holding

                             I have changed the font size so that it is so easy to see .\\n40

books I've purchased aren't great, fontwise .\\n41

.\\n42                                                                                                                                                                                                While not as much text fits on a screen as on a mass, market paperback page using the font size I like, pushing the  next page  button has become second nature .\\n43                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                         It's also easy to make the font larger whenever necessary, like when my eyes are tired .\\n44

           1All the fonts look exactly the same, regardless of the book .\\n45

read to you if you want it too !\\n46

                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                             I also like that the amount of whitespace   as well as font size on, screen is configurable .\\n48                                                                                                                                                                                                                                          I can still make out words with the use of strong glasses and setting the font to the largest possible on the Kindle2 .\\n49

relaxing, and its good to be able to change the size of the font .\\n50

perfect size for my eyes .\\n51



ability to change the font size on the KINDLE she was able to once again start reading a book .\\n54

exacerbated by the bright whiteness of the unit's housing .\\n55                                                                                                            However, just last night, I ran across a couple of user fixes for the font smoothing problem, and I've already put a  skin  on mine so that the contrast between the ePaper display's gray background and the  frame's  white is no longer an issue .\\n56                                                                                                                                                                                                      I have a bit of macular degeneration, and when reading the Kindle, for some reason, that little blurry spot does not show up, and this is at a small font .\\n57                                                                                                                                                                                                                 The Kindle 2 is lightweight, easy to hold, easy to read, and I love the fact that I can change the size of the font, depending on my situation .\\n58                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                          I am in my 50's and the reading vision isn't great so changing the font is a blessing .\\n59                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                The interface is a bit like reading newsprint, though you can change the font size to 6 or 8 different settings .\\n60

.\\n61



                                                                                         great ride, quiet comfortable spacious cabin, superior electronics  , fair price and good looks .\\n30

comfortable on the road .\\n31                                                                                                                                 The interior is very luxurious and comfortable, however the car feels slower than my 2002 Camry LE .\\n32                                                                                                                                                                    For the comfort and entertainment of the ride, I like the Camry .\\n33

                            I have had no transmission issues or rattling, the comfort and ride of this vehicle felt to me much more high end then what I had paid .\\n35                                                                                                                                                                    I love the look, and the comfort, but would never buy one again .\\n36    I've read other reviews stating that the leather seats were not comfortable for long drives due to lack of cushion support, but that's not been the case for me especially after recently driving from Houston to Key West, Fla .\\n37                                                                                                                                                                                                    The seats were very comfortable .\\n38                                                                                                                                         The car comfort, looks, performance and fuel economy are great but the paint is a disaster .\\n39

                                      I was not sure at first about trading my 01 Honda Accord but have been more than satisfied with the performance, looks, and comfort .\\n41                                                                                                                                       A little stiffer ride than the xl and xle models I have had, but still comfortable and quiet .\\n42                                                                                                                                                                                                  Very comfortable ride and seating .\\n43                                                                                                                                                                 Very low interior noise level, which adds to the long trip comfort .\\n44                                                                                                The ride, comfort, and drive is as expected, however, the quality and reputation of yore are completely gone for the flagship Camry .\\n45                                                                                       Over the month it was in the shop, we rented several different cars and nothing seemed to measure up to the comfort and options of the Camry .\\n46                                                                                                     The seat comfort is not as it was and I found that the gas, brake pedals are offset too much to the left of my body centerline .\\n47                                                                                                                                                                                                   Very comfortable, quiet

than previous model but comfortable on trips .\\n49                                                                                                                                                           Feels expensive, yet comfortable with larger interior than my Grand Prix .\\n50

                                                             I feel that the Camry just gets better and better in terms of comfort, styling and performance with each generation .\\n53

                                 I do not find the front seats as comfortable as the seats in my old 96 Ford taurus .\\n75                                                                                                                Toyota made many improvements since 03, including more comfortable front seats, better rear seat room and comfort   .\\n76

quite impressive .\\n78                                                                                                                                           My passengers are expecially happy

tendency to fall asleep, , which I think emphasizes how comfortable, smooth, and quiet it is .\\n80                                                                                                                                          It is a very comfortable car that gives us options that we never had on previous vehicles .\\n81                                               I test drove and compared similar 4 door sedans like the Maxima, Accord, Mazda6, and noticed that none had all the features,performance,comfort ,safety,and looks that the Camry has .\\n82                                                                                                                                                                                 The navigation works flawlessly, comfortable seats

great,comfortable and gas mileage great .\\n84                                                                                                                                   I would recommend this car to anyone looking for a comfortable ride as well as good fuel economy .\\n85                                                                                                                             The seats were very comfortable on a four and a half hour   trip, and wind and road noise were minimal .\\n86                                                                                                                                 The interior is much more comfortable than my last 3 Camrys and the exterior styling is oh so chic .\\n87

Camry .\\n89                                                                                   Having flown 26 different aircraft and driven cars for 61 years, I find the 2007 Camry to be the most uncomfortable cockpit I have every been in .\\n90                                                                                                The headrest presses into my head at an uncomfortable angle and it is imposssible to tell where the front of the car is for parking .\\n91                                                                                                                                                              The window sill is too high and the armrest too low to be comfortable .\\n92                                                                                                        The new looks are what attracted it to me initially, but its relatively smooth drive, comfort and reliability sold me on it .\\n93                                                                                                                    It is a beautiful sapphire blue, has really nice lines, is very comfortable, is plenty peppy, and hugs the road .\\n94                             The ride is very comfortable, although I'm 6'6  and I didn't think head room was an issue but I do think leg room could be better, I think this is mainly because the back seats have tons of leg room .\\n95                                                                                                                                                                                            It is so comfortable and drives perfect .\\n96                                                                                                              Overall this car is very quiet, comfortable, smooth, powerful, and absolutly the best mid, size in the current market .\\n97

a vibration shimmy problem at 70 mph, visited dealer three times and ended up with changing a new tire and now the ride is even quieter and comfortable .\\n99                                                                                                                                                                                                     Leather seats were comfortable .\\n100

Sonata is thousands of dollars cheaper and matches the Camry in all respects except comfort .\\n103                                                                                        Bottom line was that I was going to be in that driver's seat for years to come and I was not going to skimp on the critical comfort factor .\\n104

interior is upgraded markedly, and although there is a bit less headroom, the added telescoping feature of the steering wheel combined with the greater travel of the seat   yields greater comfort .\\n106                                                                                                                                                   , a luxurious comfort feature, and a fuel consumption that is best in the class .\\n107                                                                                                                                              Nice looking interior but seats are very hard and are not comfortable for long trips .\\n108

                                             The car is VERY comfortable and the air conditioning is perfect for the heat here in Arizona .\\n110

    This new Camry is indeed very comfortable with quiet and soft ride .\\n114

                                  I am not real fond of the electric seat and I find it is not as comfortable as my F150 pickup on trips .\\n116

the MPG for the 2 .\\n40

handles are too hard and plasticky, some rattles especially when cold outside, not overly fond of the center console design .\\n42

ton of style and lots of interior room without being to bulky on the outside .\\n43

really is no fun factor to it .\\n44

                     The interior is on par with other cars in its class, but not up to the fit and finish of previous Camrys   .\\n55    Examples include fit and finish  had to have the drivers door realigned due to metal, to, metal contact causing terrible rattling  , poor fit of interior parts, which causes a lot of rattling, especially when it's cold out  the auto tranny has a history of serious problems and acts weird, and lastly the paint quality, which chips very easily .\\n56

the seats gave me and my wife back pain after 20 minutes of driving !\\n11

                                                             The only for sure complaint I have is the seats seems to hurt my back after I drove for a period of time, this may be because I am use to my silverado truck with leather bucket seats .\\n30                 DON'T rely on your test drive, the seats are Very uncomfortable and when the engine goes into the  econo  mode the vehicle  shifts rocks violently  forward and when leaving the  econo  mode it shifts rocks forward once again which means that the vehicle is  CONTINUOUSLY  SHAKING AND ROCKING .\\n31

front seats are extremely uncomfortable after anything more than 15 minutes of driving due to what I see as a design flaw, the seat curvature is too great, and even with the lumbar support all the way retracted, it still feels like there is some type of bar sticking out in the wrong part of my back   .\\n34                                                                                                                However, long, distance comfort  is poor due to hard, narrow and deeply, bucketed seats combined with a very taut suspension which transmits even minor road imperfections through the whole vehicle .\\n35                                                                                                                                                  At first the seats seemed stiffer than I'd like, but after making a 2 1 2 hour trip, It felt very comfortable once I got the seat and lumbar adjusted to my liking .\\n36
